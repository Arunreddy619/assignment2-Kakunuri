>Sqrt (or Square Root) Decomposition Technique is one of the most common query optimization technique used by competitive programmers.  This technique helps us to reduce Time Complexity by a factor of sqrt(n). 
The key concept of this technique is to decompose given array into small chunks specifically of size sqrt(n).

```
// input data
int n;
vector<int> a (n);

// preprocessing
int len = (int) sqrt (n + .0) + 1; // size of the block and the number of blocks
vector<int> b (len);
for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
    b[i / len] += a[i];

// answering the queries
for (;;) {
    int l, r;
  // read input data for the next query
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i=l; i<=r; )
        if (i % len == 0 && i + len - 1 <= r) {
            // if the whole block starting at i belongs to [l, r]
            sum += b[i / len];
            i += len;
        }
        else {
            sum += a[i];
            ++i;
        }
}
